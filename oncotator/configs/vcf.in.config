# This list is case sensitive.
#
# Procedure: 
#	1)  Use the annotation on the mutation with the name of the column.
#	2)  If this is not found, go through the alternates until one is found as an annotation on the mutation.
#	3)  If still not found, use blank value.
# For example, if no annotation named "Start_position" is found, attempt to populate the Start_position column with values found in the start_pos, start, or pos annotations, in that order.
# Start_position:  start_pos,start,pos
