# This list is case sensitive.
#
# Procedure: 
#	1)  Use the annotation on the mutation with the name of the column.
#	2)  If this is not found, go through the alternates until one is found as an annotation on the mutation.
#	3)  If still not found, use blank value.
# For example, if no annotation named "Start_position" is found, attempt to populate the Start_position column with values found in the start_pos, start, or pos annotations, in that order.
# Start_position:  start_pos,start,pos
[INFO]
ancestral_allele: AA ; ancestral allele
allele_count: AC ; allele count in genotypes, for each ALT allele, in the same order as listed
allele_frequency: AF ; allele frequency for each ALT allele in the same order as listed: use this when estimated from primary data, not called genotypes
total_allele_number: AN ; total number of alleles in called genotypes
base_quality: BQ ; RMS base quality at this position
cigar: CIGAR ; cigar string describing how to align an alternate allele to the reference allele
dbSNP_membership: DB
depth_across_samples: DP ; combined depth across samples, e.g. DP=154
var_end_pos: END ; end position of the variant described in this record (esp. for CNVs)
hapmap2_membership: H2
mapping_quality: MQ ; RMS mapping quality, e.g. MQ=52
mapq0_number: MQ0 ; Number of MAPQ == 0 reads covering this record
samples_number: NS ; Number of samples with data
strand_bias: SB ; strand bias at this position
somatic: SOMATIC ; indicates that the record is a somatic mutation, for cancer genomics
validated: VALIDATED ; validated by follow-up experiment

[FORMAT]
genotype: GT ; encoded as alleles values separated by either of "/" or "|"
read_depth: DP ; read depth at this position for this sample
sample_genotype_filter: FT ; indicates if this genotype was "called" (similar in concept to the FILTER field)
genotype_quality: GQ ;
haplotype_quality: HQ ;
