   Detailed parameter information:
       
   datasource type  -- 
       "gene_tsv" -- gene indexed file.  gene must be a Hugo Symbol.
           TSVs must:
               1) have a single column for the Hugo Symbol
               2) have column names on the first line.  
                   TODO: Support prefix comment lines starting with '#'
       
       "gp_tsv" -- tsv file referenced by genome position.
           TSVs must:
               1) have the column names on the first line.  
                   TODO: Support prefix comment lines starting with '#'
               2) have three distinct columns for chromosome, start position, and end position.  Note that the names of these columns are specified in the 
                   genomic position columns (see below)
               3) tsv --> tab separated values, so the file must be a table of tab-separated values with the same number of values on every row.

       "gpp_tsv" -- tsv file referenced by gene and protein position.
           TSVs must:
               1) have the column names on the first line.
                   TODO: Support prefix comment lines starting with '#'
               2) have three distinct columns for gene, start AA position, and end AA position.  Note that the names of these columns are specified in the
                   gene Protein Position columns (see below)
               3) tsv --> tab separated values, so the file must be a table of tab-separated values with the same number of values on every row.


       "transcript_tsv" -- tsv file referenced by transcript_id
            TSV has the same requirements as gene_tsv, except that the single column must be for transcript_id.
             Note:  This is inherently coupled with the transcript providing datasource used.

       "indexed_vcf" -- vcf file referenced by chromosome and position

       "indexed_tsv" -- tsv file referenced by chromosome, start position and end position

   datasource filename -- input data file.  In the case of tabix_gp_tsv, it would be the source tsv file.
   name -- arbitrary name for the datasource.  This will be the folder moved into the the destination db dir.  Must be unique from other datasources.  
       This will be a prefix on all annotations from this datasource.
       E.g. CancerGeneCensus
   version -- version of the datasource.  This should be the version of the data itself, such as '3.0' for Gaf 3.0
   destination database directory -- an Oncotator database directory.
   destination datasource directory -- directory name that this datasource should have.  E.g. cancer_gene_census
   genome_build -- The genome build.  E.g. hg19        
   index columns -- the columns that are indexed.
       For gene_tsv, this would be a single column name for the Hugo_Symbol, e.g. "Symbol"
       For gpp_tsv, this MUST be a triplet specifying gene, AA start, and AA end.  For a single amino acid, start should equal end.
   
   Example usages:
   # Create the abridged cancer gene census datasource as a generic tsv, using the Symbol column as the gene column 
   python initializeDataSource.py gene_tsv CancerGeneCensus_Table_1_full_2012-03-15_trim.txt CGC full_2012_03_15 ~/oncotest cgc hg19 Symbol

   # Create a datasource for ORegAnno (a generic genome position tsv)

   # Create a MutSig Published Results datasource (a gene tsv) and put it into ~/oncotest/mutsig.  
   python initializeDataSource.py gene_tsv mutsig_results.import.20110905.txt "MutSig Published Results" "20110905" ~/oncotest mutsig hg19 gene
