BROAD INSTITUTE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
FOR ACADEMIC NON-COMMERCIAL RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY

This Agreement is made between the Broad Institute, Inc. with a principal address at 7 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142 ("BROAD") and the LICENSEE and is effective at the date the downloading is completed ("EFFECTIVE DATE").

WHEREAS, LICENSEE desires to license the PROGRAM, as defined hereinafter, and BROAD wishes to have this PROGRAM utilized in the public interest, subject only to the royalty-free, nonexclusive, nontransferable license rights of the United States Government pursuant to 48 CFR 52.227-14; and

WHEREAS, LICENSEE desires to license the PROGRAM and BROAD desires to grant a license on the following terms and conditions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants made herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS
1.1 "PROGRAM" shall mean the object code and source code known as Oncotator 1.0 and related documentation, if any, as they exist on the EFFECTIVE DATE and can be downloaded from http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/oncotator on the EFFECTIVE DATE.  BROAD acknowledges that the PROGRAM employs one or more public domain code(s) that are freely available for public use.

2. LICENSE
2.1   Grant.

LICENSEE hereby automatically grants to BROAD a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to any LICENSEE bug fixes or modifications to the PROGRAM with unlimited rights to sublicense and/or distribute.  LICENSEE agrees to provide any such modifications and bug fixes to BROAD promptly upon their creation.  The LICENSEE may apply the PROGRAM in a pipeline to data owned by users other than the LICENSEE and provide these users the results of the PROGRAM provided LICENSEE does so for academic non-commercial purposes only.  For clarification purposes, academic sponsored research is not a commercial use under the terms of this Agreement.
