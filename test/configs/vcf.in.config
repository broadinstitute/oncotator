# This list is case sensitive.
#
# Procedure: 
#	1)  Use the annotation on the mutation with the name of the column.
#	2)  If this is not found, go through the alternates until one is found as an annotation on the mutation.
#	3)  If still not found, use blank value.
# For example, if no annotation named "Start_position" is found, attempt to populate the Start_position column with values found in the start_pos, start, or pos annotations, in that order.
# Start_position:  start_pos,start,pos
[INFO]
ancestral_allele: AA ; ancestral allele
allele_count: AC ; allele count in genotypes, for each ALT allele, in the same order as listed
allele_frequency: AF ; allele frequency for each ALT allele in the same order as listed: use this when estimated from primary data, not called genotypes
total_allele_number: AN ; total number of alleles in called genotypes
base_quality: BQ ; RMS base quality at this position
cigar: CIGAR ; cigar string describing how to align an alternate allele to the reference allele
dbSNP_membership: DB
